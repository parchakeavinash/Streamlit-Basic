Improve User Interaction:
Consider using the selected values from the widgets to perform certain actions or update visualizations dynamically. For example, update charts based on the selected programming language or branch.

Enhance Visualizations:
Experiment with different chart types, colors, and styles to make your data visualizations more appealing and informative.

Interactive Elements:
Incorporate interactive elements like buttons or sliders to trigger specific actions or filter data dynamically.

Data Input Validation:
Add input validation to ensure that the user provides valid information or adheres to certain constraints.

Styling and Theming:
Explore Streamlit's theming options to customize the appearance of your app. You can use the st.set_page_config function to set the app's title, favicon, and layout.

Deploying the App:
If you haven't already, consider deploying your Streamlit app. Platforms like Streamlit Sharing, Heroku, or GitHub Pages are popular choices.
